"""Extraction-fidelity validator — snippet-entailment for extracted diseases.

The three LinkML validators check *structure* (schema), *term existence* (CHEBI/MONDO
resolve), and *literature snippets* (PMID abstracts). None of them check that a disease
we extracted from a **regulatory** free-text section is actually *stated in that section*.
That gap is where LLM hallucination and indication↔contraindication inversion hide
(see FAILURE_MODES.md §4.1, §5.1, §8.1).

This validator closes the detection half: for every extracted disease it asks
*"does the source text the LLM was shown actually contain this disease?"* by lexical
entailment — the fraction of the disease label's content tokens that appear in the
source snippet/section. It is deterministic and offline (no network, no LLM).

Scores are intentionally lenient, and a low score means **review**, not **wrong**:

* score ~1.0  — the disease string appears (near) verbatim in the source. Entailed.
* 0 < score < threshold — partial overlap: usually LLM canonicalization
  ("type 2 diabetes" -> "type 2 diabetes mellitus") or a synonym the source spells
  differently ("high blood pressure" -> "hypertension"). Worth a curator's glance.
* score == 0 — none of the disease's content words appear in the source text. A likely
  hallucination or a mis-sectioned extraction (contraindication pulled into indications).

Because the stored snippet may be truncated (evidence snippets are capped at 500 chars),
the check also folds in the record's full section fields (``indications_text``,
``contraindications_text``, ``notes``) when present, to avoid false "not found" flags.

Alongside entailment it runs an **assertion-polarity** check (FAILURE_MODES §4.1-4.2): an
INDICATION whose disease sits inside a negated / excluded scope in the source ("should not
be used in type 1 diabetes", "except in active tuberculosis", "not indicated for asthma")
is flagged as a likely inversion — a disease the drug is contraindicated in, wrongly
recorded as an approval. Together these are the deterministic second-pass verifier.
