"""Read-side accessors for the transformation-provenance product shape.

The v2.0 products model a drug's identity as a :class:`Mention` (``mention.resolved_id`` /
``mention.resolved_label``) and its approvals as a ``RegulatoryStatus`` list
(``approvals[].authority``); an association references the drug as a light ``DrugRef``
(``drug.id`` / ``drug.label``) and inlines the disease as a ``Mention``
(``disease.resolved_id``). These helpers give every consumer (exports, coverage,
reliability) one place to read those fields, so the flat→provenance mapping lives here and
not smeared across modules. Each accessor tolerates a partially-populated record (returns
``""`` / empty set) rather than raising.
