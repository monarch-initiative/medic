"""Shared grounding logic for drug and disease source ingests.

This is the centralized plumbing for MeDIC entity resolution. The default and
intended path is the **deterministic two-stage lexical grounder**:

  Stage 1 — grounding (source string -> initial id) via the lexical SQLite index
            (``medic.grounding.lexical_backend.LexicalCascadeGrounding``), with every
            decision (including failures) written to the SSSOM decision store under
            ``mappings/{drug,disease}_grounding.sssom.tsv``.
  Stage 2 — normalization (initial id -> canonical MONDO/CHEBI) via the target
            namespace's own asserted xrefs/replaced_by, written to
            ``mappings/{disease,drug}_normalization.sssom.tsv``.

Each record receives the structured ``grounding`` and ``normalization`` objects
(see ``medic/schema/grounding.yaml``) **and** a backwards-compatible set of flat
fields (``normalized_id``, ``normalized_label``, ``grounding_confidence``,
``grounding_service``, ``grounding_status``, ``alternate_ids``) that the merge and
export stages still read. The flat fields are a compatibility shim mapped from the
new result (see ``_apply_result``); do not remove them until merge/export migrate.

Legacy non-lexical backends (``cascade``/``nameres``/``oak``/``ols``/``gilda``) still
work through the fallback path in ``_ground_one_legacy`` and continue to populate
only the flat fields.
