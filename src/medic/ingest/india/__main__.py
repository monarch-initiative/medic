"""India drug ingest — Central Drugs Standard Control Organisation (CDSCO).

Reads fresh year-by-year PDFs from the CDSCO listing page. This is the single
acquisition path: if the PDFs cannot be fetched or parsed, ingest fails loudly
rather than silently degrading to any legacy table.

NOTE: Contraindication extraction is NOT feasible for CDSCO. CDSCO publishes
only year-batch tabulation PDFs ("List of New Drugs Approved in YYYY"), which
contain a single "Indication" column and no contraindications field. There is
no per-drug landing page, no per-product label or SmPC, and no SPL-equivalent
artifact hosted by CDSCO. Indian package inserts ("PIL") exist commercially
but are not made available by CDSCO under a free, machine-accessible feed.
Until a per-product authoritative document feed appears, CDSCO contributes
INDIA-jurisdiction indications only — never contraindications.
