"""RxNorm substance-level resolver (Phase 4 of formulation grounding).

Bridges the *unresolved* drug-string residue to CHEBI without any structure
mapping: for a product string the deterministic lexical grounder cannot ground,
call the free RxNav REST API (``approximateTerm`` -> best RxCUI -> its ingredient
``IN`` concepts -> each ingredient's clean INN name), then feed those clean INN
names back through MeDIC's own lexical grounder to reach CHEBI/DRON.

Determinism guard
-----------------
RxNav is a *network* call, so it must NOT live inside the offline matcher. This
module runs as a separate, **cached** enrichment (``cache/enrichment/rxnorm_resolve.json``,
resumable) and writes the recovered mappings as *proposed* rows into the grounding
SSSOM store (``mappings/drug_grounding.sssom.tsv``). Those proposals carry a distinct
``subject_preprocessing`` rule (``rxnorm_resolve``) so a curator can review them; offline
grounding runs then read them deterministically from the store.

False-positive guard
--------------------
``approximateTerm`` always returns *some* candidate, even for substances absent from
RxNorm (e.g. ``Sheep Pox Vaccine`` -> ``menthol``). We therefore keep an ingredient
only when its (stemmed) name is a token/substring of the source string. This drops the
spurious matches at the cost of a few conservative misses.
