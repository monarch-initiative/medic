"""KGX export: a complete Biolink knowledge graph of everything MeDIC knows.

Reads every product — drugs, diseases, indications, contraindications, research
associations and adverse events — and writes Biolink-conformant nodes and edges as JSONL,
plus content metadata and a proposed infores entry.

Two things shape the output; both are argued in
``specs/2026-08-13-kgx-export-design.md``:

* **One edge per source assertion.** Each edge is single-sourced, so it carries exactly one
  ``primary_knowledge_source``, one document, one quoted span and one confidence. Pair-level
  aggregates ride along on every edge, so the collapsed drug-disease view is a ``GROUP BY``.
* **Two layers.** A strictly Biolink-valid core that a Translator ingest can consume
  unchanged, plus a ``medic_``-namespaced extension layer carrying everything Biolink has no
  slot for. A strict consumer drops the extension layer with one rule and still has a valid
  graph.
