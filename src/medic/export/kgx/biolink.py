"""The pinned Biolink vocabulary MeDIC's KGX export is allowed to emit.

Every category, predicate, enum value and un-namespaced slot the exporter writes is named
here once, and :mod:`medic.export.kgx.validate` checks each of them against the *installed*
Biolink model. That is the whole point of the module: a mapping table that is checked
against the standard cannot quietly drift into terms Biolink does not define, which is how
``biolink:contraindicated_for`` — a predicate that has never existed in Biolink 4.x — ended
up on every contraindication edge MeDIC shipped.

Anything MeDIC knows that Biolink has no slot for is emitted under the ``medic_`` prefix
(:data:`EXTENSION_SLOTS`), so a strict consumer can drop the whole extension layer with one
rule and still have a valid graph.
