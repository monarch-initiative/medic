"""Statement typing + a lightweight, source-uniform reliability score.

The soft-launch enabler (see specs/2026-07-26-soft-launch-reliability-design.md): give a
downstream consumer a one-line way to import just the part of MeDIC that is already
fairly trustworthy. Two orthogonal knobs:

* :class:`StatementType` — *what kind* of claim a record makes. ``CORE_TYPES`` (drug
  approval + indication + contraindication) are the regulatory backbone; adverse events
  and research associations are non-core.
* :class:`ReliabilityTier` — *how trustworthy* the record is, scored the **same way for
  every source** from normalized per-record signals (never by source name), so the
  idiosyncrasies of DailyMed vs GRLS vs CDE don't leak into the score. The score is the
  worst (most conservative) of a few independent gates, each mapping one failure-mode
  family (FAILURE_MODES.md) to a tier:

  1. **grounding** — is the entity resolution solid? (FM §grounding)
  2. **recognition** — was the entity itself correctly recognised in the source text?
     (the Mention's ExtractionStep flags: hallucination / truncated / coreference; FM §5)
  2b. **assertion** — does the source actually claim this *relation*, and not negate it?
     (the association's Assertion: confidence + negated_inversion / over_extraction /
     wrong_section / wrong_pairing; FM §4-5, via medic.validation.extraction_fidelity).
     Kept separate from recognition on purpose: an entity can be recognised perfectly while
     the asserted relation is wrong (the VITAMIN A -> hyperthyroidism case).

  **Not every flag these gates read has a machine emitter, and the difference matters when
  reading a tier.** Emitted today: `truncated_snippet` (recognition), and
  `negated_inversion` / `over_extraction` / `wrong_section` (assertion). Curator-supplied
  only: `hallucination`, `coreference_ambiguity`, `scope_narrowed`, `wrong_pairing` — no
  deterministic detector exists for them, and inferring them from lexical entailment would
  mislabel synonymy as fabrication. So a HIGH tier means "nothing we can detect is wrong",
  not "a human checked it"; that stronger claim is what `review_status: CONFIRMED` in
  `mappings/statement_review.tsv` is for. Every one of these read zero across all 12,694
  assertions until the detectors above were wired in, which made two of the five gates
  decorative — see `_recognition_gate`.
  3. **translation** — did the name survive machine translation unreviewed? (FM §7)
  4. **provenance** — does the claim have *any* verifiable provenance (snippet, resolvable
     reference/URL, or registry application id)? Only *absence* is penalised — a direct
     document deep link is a source publishing convention, NOT a reliability signal, so
     sources that don't publish one (Orange Book, GRLS, CDE) are never structurally capped.

A gate returns ``None`` when it does not apply (a structured approval has no extraction
gate); the provenance gate always applies, so nothing reaches HIGH by absence of signal.

**Two invariants (see the design spec §7):**

* *Every statement can reach HIGH on its own merits* — no gate caps a whole source below
  HIGH for a reason a good record can't overcome.
* *Human review mitigates all concerns* — a curator marking a statement ``review_status:
  CONFIRMED`` forces HIGH, overriding every automated gate (the statement-level twin of the
  per-decision hatches already honoured: grounding ``curated`` and translation ``OFFICIAL``).

The "mostly reliable" subset a consumer imports = ``statement_type in CORE_TYPES`` and
``reliability in {HIGH, MEDIUM}``. Curation (REVIEW.md) moves records upward automatically
on rebuild.
