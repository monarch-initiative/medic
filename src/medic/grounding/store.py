"""Grounding decision store — SSSOM literal-mappings profile.

One hand-editable TSV per entity type under ``mappings/``. Rows are grouped by the
base-normalized subject literal; a literal may have several rows (combination drugs map
one string to several ids). Rows tagged ``semapv:ManualMappingCuration`` are the
authoritative cache: if a subject has any manual row, its whole row-set is preserved on
regeneration and wins over auto (``semapv:LexicalMatching``) rows. Unresolved decisions
are written too — as ``object_id: sssom:NoTermFound`` against a real predicate — so the
store is a complete audit that a standard SSSOM reader can still read.
