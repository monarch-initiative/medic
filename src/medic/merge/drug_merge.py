"""Drug merge: combines drug source records into a unified drug list.

Reads all kb/drugs/<source>/*.yaml files, groups by normalized_id,
merges metadata across sources, and writes products/drug_list.yaml.

Merge logic:
1. Load all source YAML files from kb/drugs/<source>/
2. Filter out records with grounding_status == "unresolved"
3. Group remaining records by normalized_id (canonical CURIE)
4. For each group, merge: source_ingredients, approval flags, marketing_status_usa,
   alternate_ids, and approval_date (earliest)
5. Write output as DrugList wrapper: {"drugs": drug_list}
