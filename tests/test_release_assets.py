"""Tests for the release asset manifest.

The manifest exists because `just gh-release` used to glob `exports/*.{csv,xlsx,jsonl,tsv}`.
A glob makes shipping the default: the KGX export added 57 MB of new release assets —
including 4.6 MB of verbatim EMA/PMDA/DailyMed label text — and nothing asked whether they
could lawfully ship. Under the manifest an unlisted file is refused, so adding an export
forces a decision instead of inheriting one.
