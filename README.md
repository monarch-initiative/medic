# MeDIC

**Medicines, Diseases, Indications, and Contraindications**

An open knowledge base of what medicines are approved to treat — built only from government
regulatory sources, and traceable back to the exact sentence a regulator published.

## What this is

Drug repurposing needs a reliable answer to a deceptively simple question: *what is this drug
already approved to treat, and where?* That answer is scattered across national regulators, in
free-text labels, in six languages, under names that rarely match.

MeDIC assembles it from the primary regulatory record — FDA, EMA, PMDA, CDSCO, GRLS, NMPA — grounds
every drug and disease to a public ontology, and keeps the full derivation so any claim can be
walked back to its source.

| | |
|---|---|
| **7,483** drug–disease indication pairs | from **11,360** individual source-document attestations |
| **2,659** contraindication pairs | from **3,305** attestations |
| **4,323** drugs | grounded to ChEBI |
| **23,224** diseases | grounded to Mondo |
| **6 jurisdictions** | USA, EU, Japan, India, Russia, China |

## Provenance is the point

Most drug–disease resources tell you *that* a drug treats a disease. MeDIC tells you **how it
knows** — every step from the string a regulator printed to the ontology term, recorded as a
replayable chain:

```yaml
original_literal: 乳酸环丙沙星氯化钠注射液        # what China's CDE published
resolution:
  output_value: CHEBI:100241                    # ciprofloxacin
  confidence: 0.855
  pipeline:
    - category: EXTRACTION      # read verbatim from the source table
      output_value: 乳酸环丙沙星氯化钠注射液
    - category: TRANSLATION     # DeepL, via babelon 0.3.6
      output_value: Ciprofloxacin Lactate and Sodium Chloride Injection
      flags: [unreviewed_machine]
    - category: GROUNDING       # salt and combination stripped, then matched
      applied_rules: [salt_ester_strip, combination_split]
      output_value: CHEBI:100241
    - category: NORMALIZATION
      output_value: CHEBI:100241
```

Each step names the tool or dated model that produced it and records both its incoming and
outgoing value, so the chain is contiguous by construction. Nothing is asserted without a
recorded reason — including the failures, which are kept rather than dropped.

An indication is scoped the same way. One canonical pair holds one assertion per attesting
**document**, so three regulators agreeing is visible as three independent attestations rather
than collapsed into one row:

```yaml
drug_label: lecanemab
disease_label: mild cognitive impairment
reliability: HIGH
confidence: {method: NOISY_OR, n_assertions: 3, overall: 0.993}
assertions:
  - {source: DAILYMED, jurisdiction: USA,   document: "DailyMed:9d1ff786-…"}
  - {source: EMA,      jurisdiction: EU,    document: "EMA:leqembi"}
  - {source: PMDA,     jurisdiction: JAPAN, document: "PMDA:LECANEMAB#22-20230925"}
```

## Products

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `products/indication_list.yaml` | Approved drug–disease indications, per-document provenance |
| `products/contraindication_list.yaml` | Contraindications (currently FDA only) |
| `products/drug_list.yaml` | Drug identities, ChEBI-grounded, with per-authority approvals |
| `products/disease_list.yaml` | Disease list, Mondo-grounded |
| `products/research_list.yaml` | Literature-derived associations (investigational) |
| `exports/` | Flat CSV/TSV for downstream use, including a reliability-filtered subset |

Every string→id and id→id decision also lands in git-tracked [SSSOM](https://mapping-commons.github.io/sssom/)
stores under `mappings/`, so grounding is reviewable and correctable by hand rather than locked
inside the code.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/monarch-initiative/medic.git
cd medic
just setup                      # install dependencies
just restore-manual-sources     # fetch the China + Russia source files
just build-on-label-list        # ingest, ground, merge
just qc                         # reconcile the build against its baseline
```

`just --list` shows everything. Two sources — China's CDE table and Russia's GRLS register —
cannot be fetched automatically and are not redistributable, so their snapshots live out-of-band
rather than in this repo. Set `MEDIC_MANUAL_SOURCES_URL` to the archive location before running the
restore recipe; see [`sources/README.md`](sources/README.md).

## How it works

Four stages, each recorded rather than implied:

1. **Ingest** — every source read from its primary publication, single-path and fail-loud. No
   source ever emits evidence for a jurisdiction it does not itself originate.
2. **Translate** — non-English drug names via DeepL, stored in [Babelon](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/babelon).
3. **Ground** — a deterministic two-stage lexical grounder resolves strings to ChEBI and Mondo,
   persisting every decision, including failures.
4. **Merge** — sources combine into canonical pairs, each retaining its per-document assertions.

Builds are offline, deterministic and byte-identical on re-run. A QC pass reconciles every source
row against the output and fails on unexplained drift.

## Contributing

Issues and pull requests are welcome at
[monarch-initiative/medic](https://github.com/monarch-initiative/medic/issues). Known gaps are
filed openly rather than hidden — coverage limits, grounding tails and uncalibrated confidence
values all have issues.

The most useful contribution is usually curation: the `mappings/` SSSOM stores are hand-editable,
and a corrected grounding row is honoured on the next build.

## License

The code and schemas are [BSD-3-Clause](LICENSE). The documentation is CC BY 4.0, and MeDIC's own
mapping assertions are CC0.

The **data products are a different matter**: they are derived from a dozen regulatory sources with
incompatible terms, and MeDIC grants no rights over them. EMA and PMDA both require attribution, so
any redistribution of a merged product must carry the notice in [`LICENSING.md`](LICENSING.md) —
which also gives the per-source breakdown and the two sources MeDIC does not redistribute at all.
